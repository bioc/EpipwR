Title: Efficient Power Analysis for EWAS with Continuous Outcomes
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jackson Barth, Austin Reynolds
Maintainer: Jackson Barth <Jackson_Barth@Baylor.edu>
Description: A quasi-simulation based approach to performing power analysis 
    for EWAS (Epigenome-wide association studies) with continuous outcomes. 
    'EpipwR' relies on empirical EWAS datasets to determine power at specific 
    sample sizes while keeping computational cost low.
