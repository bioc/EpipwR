# EpipwR
EpipwR is an R package for conducting power analysis for EWAS with continuous outcomes. It is based on empirical EWAS to generate realistic datasets while leveraging classic statistical theory to cut down on computation time. Our corresponding paper is currently under review at Bioinformatics.

# Installation
EpipwR currently requires R version 4.4.0 or later. 
```
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("jbarth216/EpipwR.data")

```

# Usage
A detailed EpipwR workflow can be found in the EpipwR vignette.
